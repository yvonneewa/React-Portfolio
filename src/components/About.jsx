Hi, I'm Yvonne, a soon-to-be Software Developer with a passion for problem solving and thinking outside the box. In my professional journey, I thrive on tackling challenges head-on and finding innovative solutions that drive projects forward. Beyond coding, I enjoy a variety of hobbies that enrich my life. You'll often find me immersed in a good book, honing my skills in sewing, exploring new destinations through travel, and recently, learning to play the violin. These activities not only fuel my creativity but also provide a well-rounded perspective that enhances my approach to problem-solving. I'm excited about the intersection of technology and creativity, and I look forward to contributing my skills and enthusiasm to impactful projects in the software development field.  </h1>
